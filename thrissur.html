            <P>Thrissur  formerly Trichur, also known by its historical name Thrissivaperur, is a city and the headquarters of the Thrissur district in Kerala, India. It is the third largest city in Kerala after Kochi and Kozhikode, and the 21st largest in India. It is famous for the Thrissur Pooram festival.

                The city is built around a 65-acre (26 ha) hillock called the Thekkinkaadu Maidaanam which seats the Vadakkumnathan temple. It is located 304 kilometres (189 mi) north-west of the state's capital city, Trivandrum.
                
                Thrissur was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin.
                
                Thrissur is known as "Cultural Capital of Kerala" due of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings throughout history. One of its main cultural events is the Thrissur Pooram, which attracts quite a number of tourists and travellers.
